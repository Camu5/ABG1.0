# ABG1.0
An Automatic Banner Generator. Useful for welcome messages! It was programmed in Bash, and, in only 30 minutes, so it's very basic.

**FOR AUTOMATIC FEATURE:**
Just run (by root) the file "name INSTALL". Write:
```
chmod 777 BASH
chmod 777 INSTALL && bash INSTALL
```

**FOR USE (only if you don't install it yet):**
Just execute the file by: 
```
chmod 777 BASH && bash BASH
```
