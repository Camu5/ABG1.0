# ABG1.0
An Automatic Banner Generator. Useful for welcome messages! It was programmed in Bash, and, in only 30 minutes, so it's very basic.

**FOR AUTOMATIC FEATURE:**
Just run (by root) the file "name INSTALL". Write: 
chmod 777 INSTALL && bash BASH

**FOR USE (only if you don't install it yet):**
Just execute the file by "bash BASH".
