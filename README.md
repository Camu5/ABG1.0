# ABG1.0
An Automatic Banner Generator. Useful for welcome messages! It is programmed in Bash and in 30 minutes, so it's very basic.

FOR AUTOMATIC FEATURE:
Just run (by root) the file "name INSTALL". Write: 
chmod 777 INSTALL && bash BASH

FOR USE (only if you don't install it yet):
Just execute the file by "bash BASH".
